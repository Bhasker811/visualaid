# ðŸš€ Visual Aid: Voice Assistant for the Visually Impaired

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
*Problem Statement 1* â€“ Creating a Web-based Application for Visually Impaired People

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The *Visual Aid* project aims to provide a voice-controlled web application that helps visually impaired individuals perform common tasks like:
- Making WhatsApp calls, sending messages, and video calling
- Getting email summaries
- Describing live images
- Controlling system functions (volume, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
- Getting directions to specific places
- Summarizing news articles

The application serves the visually impaired community by giving them independence and making digital interactions accessible.

### Your Approach:
We chose this problem because of the increasing need for accessible technologies that help people with disabilities, especially the visually impaired. The project focuses on voice control to enable users to perform key tasks without the need for physical interaction with a screen. We faced challenges with integrating multiple APIs, speech recognition, and ensuring seamless interactions, but overcame them with effective brainstorming and technical pivots.
